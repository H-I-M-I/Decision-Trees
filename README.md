# Decision Trees for Drug Classification

This project implements a Decision Tree classification model to predict the appropriate drug for a patient based on historical medical data.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of patient records, including features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and medication response.

## Features Used
- Age
- Sex
- Blood Pressure Level
- Cholesterol Level
- Sodium-to-Potassium Ratio

## Model
A Decision Tree classifier is trained using labeled data to predict the drug category for new patients.

## Requirements
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model.
3. Use the trained model to predict drug recommendations for new patients.

## Results
The trained Decision Tree model accurately classifies patient cases and suggests suitable medications.
